## Deliverables

We've been asked to build a website for a new restaurant, Flatburger, that displays a menu of food served at the restaurant.

Today we will review JavaScript Fundamentals that may help us accomplish some tasks related to displaying data on the website.

1. Initialize a variable named `greeting` using `const` and assign it the value of the `string` "Welcome to Flatburger!"
2. Initialize two variables named `num1` and `num2` using `let` and assign the value of a `number` to each of the two variables.
3. Initialize a variable named `sum` using `let` and assign it the value resulting from the sum of values of the variables `num1` and `num2`.
4. Initialize a variable named `sumString` using `let` whose value should incorporate the values of `num1`, `num2`, and `sum` into the string using string concatenation or string interpolation. For example, if `num1` has the value of 7, `num2` has the value 14, and `sum` has the value of 21, the value of `sumString` should be `7 + 14 = 21`.
5. Write an `if` statement that will check if the value of `num1` is strictly equal to `7` or `49`. If `num1` is strictly equal to `7` or `49`, use `console.log()` to print the following string to the console: "That's a lucky number!"
6. Write an `else` clause after the `if` statement that will print "That's not a lucky number." to the console using `console.log()`.

Note: The code inside the `else` clause should run if the `if` statement's condition is not true.


## Variables
A variable is a container in which we can store values for later retrieval.

Imagine a box that can hold any type of data: a number, a string, etc. We take some data that we want to store, place it inside the box, and hand the box off to the JavaScript engine, which stores it in memory. All done! Our data is safely cached until we need to access it again.

This is how we initialize variables in JavaScript. First, we declare the variable, then we assign a value to it

```
const number = 7

let phrase = "Hello World!"
```

When you declare a variable with const, it cannot be reasigned

```
const number = 7

number = 8
//=> Uncaught TypeError: Assignment to constant variable.
```

## Data Types
Data types describe the different types or kinds of data that we will be working with and storing in variables. The three most basic data types in JavaScript are `number`, `string`, and `boolean`.

A `number` is a numerical value such as `7` or `4.9`

```
const number = 7
```

A `string` is a series of characters such as `Hello World`. A string can be any text inside single quotes `''`, double quotes `""`, or backticks ` `` `

```
const phrase = 'Hello World!'

const anotherPhrase = "Welcome to Flatiron School!"

const yetAnotherPhrase = `Strings are awesome!`
```

A `boolean` value is one that can either be `true` or `false`

```
let isStudent = true

let isHungry = false
```

The `typeof` operator can be used to check the data type of a value or variable's value

```
typeof 7
//=> 'number'

typeof "Hello"
//=> 'string'

typeof true
//=> 'boolean'
```
